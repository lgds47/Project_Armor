# Environment Dependencies Resolution Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure all environment dependencies are in place for testing scripts and the overall pipeline.

## Issue Summary

The project was experiencing issues with missing or improperly installed dependencies, particularly:

1. ModuleNotFoundError for 'albumentations' despite being listed in requirements.txt
2. PyTorch (torch) and torchvision not explicitly listed in requirements.txt
3. scikit-multilearn listed in requirements.txt but not in setup.py
4. Lack of comprehensive environment setup documentation and verification

These issues were causing test scripts to fail and preventing proper testing of the pipeline.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Comprehensive Environment Setup Script

Created `setup_environment.sh` that:
- Checks for Python 3.11
- Creates a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Detects CUDA availability and installs PyTorch with appropriate support
- Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
- Explicitly installs scikit-multilearn
- Installs the package in development mode
- Verifies the installation of all key dependencies
- Provides clear error messages and guidance

### 2. Created Detailed Environment Setup Documentation

Created `docs/environment_setup.md` that provides:
- Requirements for the environment
- Quick setup instructions using the setup script
- Manual setup instructions
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting guidance for common issues:
  - Python version issues
  - Virtual environment issues
  - PyTorch installation issues
  - Albumentations installation issues
  - Import errors
  - CUDA issues
- Docker environment instructions
- Common issues and solutions

### 3. Updated README with Environment Setup Information

Updated the Installation section in README.md to:
- Add information about the setup_environment.sh script
- Link to the environment_setup.md guide
- Provide more detailed manual setup instructions
- Include scikit-multilearn installation

### 4. Created Environment Test Plan

Created `docs/environment_test_plan.md` that outlines:
- Prerequisites for testing
- Step-by-step test procedure
- Expected outcomes
- Troubleshooting guidance
- Test results documentation template

## Root Causes and Solutions

### 1. Missing PyTorch and torchvision in requirements.txt

**Root Cause**: PyTorch and torchvision were installed separately with specific CUDA support, not through requirements.txt.

**Solution**: 
- Added explicit installation of PyTorch and torchvision in the setup script
- Documented the need for separate installation in the environment setup guide
- Added CUDA detection to install the appropriate version

### 2. Albumentations Import Error

**Root Cause**: Although albumentations was listed in requirements.txt, it might not have been properly installed or there might have been path issues.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit verification of albumentations installation in the setup script
- Added troubleshooting guidance for albumentations issues
- Ensured the package is installed in development mode

### 3. scikit-multilearn Inconsistency

**Root Cause**: scikit-multilearn was listed in requirements.txt but not in setup.py, leading to potential installation issues.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit installation of scikit-multilearn in the setup script
- Added verification of scikit-multilearn installation
- Documented the dependency in the environment setup guide

## Recommendations for Future Environment Management

### 1. Dependency Management

- **Use a dependency management tool** like Poetry or Pipenv to manage dependencies more reliably
- **Separate core and development dependencies** to make it clear which are needed for production vs. development
- **Pin all dependency versions** to ensure reproducibility
- **Document dependency installation order** when it matters (e.g., PyTorch before other dependencies)

### 2. Environment Verification

- **Add a verification script** that checks all dependencies are correctly installed
- **Run verification as part of CI/CD** to catch environment issues early
- **Include version compatibility checks** to ensure dependencies work together

### 3. Documentation

- **Keep environment setup documentation up-to-date** as dependencies change
- **Document known issues and solutions** to help future developers
- **Include platform-specific instructions** for Windows, macOS, and Linux

### 4. Testing

- **Test environment setup on clean systems** regularly
- **Include environment setup in onboarding documentation** for new team members
- **Create Docker images for testing** to ensure consistent environments

## Conclusion

The changes made have addressed the immediate issues with environment dependencies and provided a more robust and well-documented environment setup process. The setup script, documentation, and test plan will help ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and verified, preventing similar issues in the future.

By following the recommendations for future environment management, the project can maintain a reliable and reproducible environment for development and testing.
