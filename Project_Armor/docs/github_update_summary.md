## Update Process

1. **Preparation**:
   - Staged all relevant modified and new files
   - Excluded unnecessary files (.DS_Store, __pycache__, .idea)
   - Committed the changes with a descriptive message

2. **Remote Repository Configuration**:
   - Verified the remote repository URL (https://github.com/lgds47/Project_Armor.git)
   - Fetched the latest changes from the remote repository

3. **Push Attempt**:
   - Attempted to push the changes to the remote repository
   - The push operation timed out (likely due to environment limitations)

## Issues Encountered

- **Push Timeout**: The attempt to push changes to the remote repository timed out. This could be due to:
  - Network connectivity issues in the test environment
  - Authentication requirements
  - Limited permissions in the test environment
  - Size of the changes being pushed

## Next Steps

In a real-world scenario, the following steps would be taken to complete the update:

1. **Retry Push with Authentication**:
   ```bash
   git push origin master
   ```
   (Provide GitHub credentials when prompted)

2. **Alternative Push Methods**:
   - Use a personal access token for authentication
   - Use SSH keys for authentication
   - Use GitHub Desktop or another Git client

3. **Verify Update**:
   - Visit https://github.com/lgds47/Project_Armor to confirm changes were pushed
   - Check commit history and file changes

## Conclusion

All necessary changes have been committed locally and are ready to be pushed to the GitHub repository. The push operation needs to be completed in an environment with proper network access and authentication capabilities.
